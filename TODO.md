Next todo:

create script to measure idle stage power usage.

Investigate how superbench deal with batch size and dataset preprocess issue of NN.
Investigate what kind of results superbench reports to user.

Investigate Power vs time issue, which means:
If I choose a small batch size to train NN, power will decrease, total time will increase. Total power may increase I guess.


An idea about connect the application to hardware.

result report:

Application based: predict how much power and time it takes to complete an AI task based on serveral iterations.
Hardware based: power cost per operation by experiments
