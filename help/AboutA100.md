NVIDIA provides a variety of power consumption data for their A100 GPU. Here is a summary of some of the key metrics:



1. TDP (Thermal Design Power): This is the maximum power consumption of the GPU as specified by the manufacturer. For the A100, NVIDIA specifies a TDP of 400W.

2. Power Draw: This is the actual power consumption of the GPU during operation. NVIDIA provides power draw data for the A100 in several different scenarios, including idle, peak FP16 performance, and peak FP64 performance.

3. GPU Utilization: This is the percentage of time that the GPU is being used for computation. Higher utilization generally corresponds to higher power consumption.

4. Clock Speeds: The GPU has a base clock speed and a boost clock speed. Higher clock speeds generally correspond to higher power consumption.

5. Memory Bandwidth: The amount of data that can be transferred to/from the GPU's memory per second. Higher memory bandwidth generally corresponds to higher power consumption.


You can find detailed power consumption data for the A100 in the GPU specifications provided by NVIDIA. In addition, NVIDIA provides tools such as the NVIDIA System Management Interface (nvidia-smi) that can be used to monitor GPU power consumption in real-time on Linux systems.


Here is a Python script that uses the `subprocess` module to call `nvidia-smi` and parse the output to get the power consumption of each part:
```
import subprocess

# Define the command to get GPU information using nvidia-smi
nvidia_smi_cmd = "nvidia-smi --query-gpu=power.draw,power.limit,fan.speed --format=csv"

# Define a function to parse the output of nvidia-smi
def parse_nvidia_smi_output(output):
    # Split the output into lines
    lines = output.strip().split('\n')
    # Get the header row and remove whitespace
    header = [h.strip() for h in lines[0].split(',')]
    # Get the data rows and split each row into values
    data = [[float(x.strip()) for x in row.split(',')] for row in lines[1:]]
    # Convert the data rows into a dictionary with the header names as keys
    return [dict(zip(header, row)) for row in data]

# Define a function to print the power consumption of each GPU part
def print_gpu_power_info(gpu_info):
    for i, info in enumerate(gpu_info):
        print(f"GPU {i}:")
        print(f"  Power Draw: {info['power.draw']} W")
        print(f"  Power Limit: {info['power.limit']} W")
        print(f"  Fan Speed:   {info['fan.speed']} %")

# Call nvidia-smi and parse the output
output = subprocess.check_output(nvidia_smi_cmd, shell=True)
gpu_info = parse_nvidia_smi_output(output.decode())

# Print the power consumption of each GPU part
print_gpu_power_info(gpu_info)
```
