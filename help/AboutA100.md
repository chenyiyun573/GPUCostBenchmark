NVIDIA provides a variety of power consumption data for their A100 GPU. Here is a summary of some of the key metrics:



1. TDP (Thermal Design Power): This is the maximum power consumption of the GPU as specified by the manufacturer. For the A100, NVIDIA specifies a TDP of 400W.

2. Power Draw: This is the actual power consumption of the GPU during operation. NVIDIA provides power draw data for the A100 in several different scenarios, including idle, peak FP16 performance, and peak FP64 performance.

3. GPU Utilization: This is the percentage of time that the GPU is being used for computation. Higher utilization generally corresponds to higher power consumption.

4. Clock Speeds: The GPU has a base clock speed and a boost clock speed. Higher clock speeds generally correspond to higher power consumption.

5. Memory Bandwidth: The amount of data that can be transferred to/from the GPU's memory per second. Higher memory bandwidth generally corresponds to higher power consumption.


You can find detailed power consumption data for the A100 in the GPU specifications provided by NVIDIA. In addition, NVIDIA provides tools such as the NVIDIA System Management Interface (nvidia-smi) that can be used to monitor GPU power consumption in real-time on Linux systems.


Here is a Python script that uses the `subprocess` module to call `nvidia-smi` and parse the output to get the power consumption of each part:
```
import subprocess

# Define the command to get GPU information using nvidia-smi
nvidia_smi_cmd = "nvidia-smi --query-gpu=power.draw,power.limit,fan.speed --format=csv"

# Define a function to parse the output of nvidia-smi
def parse_nvidia_smi_output(output):
    # Split the output into lines
    lines = output.strip().split('\n')
    # Get the header row and remove whitespace
    header = [h.strip() for h in lines[0].split(',')]
    # Get the data rows and split each row into values
    data = [[float(x.strip()) for x in row.split(',')] for row in lines[1:]]
    # Convert the data rows into a dictionary with the header names as keys
    return [dict(zip(header, row)) for row in data]

# Define a function to print the power consumption of each GPU part
def print_gpu_power_info(gpu_info):
    for i, info in enumerate(gpu_info):
        print(f"GPU {i}:")
        print(f"  Power Draw: {info['power.draw']} W")
        print(f"  Power Limit: {info['power.limit']} W")
        print(f"  Fan Speed:   {info['fan.speed']} %")

# Call nvidia-smi and parse the output
output = subprocess.check_output(nvidia_smi_cmd, shell=True)
gpu_info = parse_nvidia_smi_output(output.decode())

# Print the power consumption of each GPU part
print_gpu_power_info(gpu_info)
```


there are other ways to get real-time power consumption data of the A100 GPU besides using `nvidia-smi`.


One way is to use the real-time power monitoring feature provided by the A100's power management subsystem (PMS). The PMS exposes a variety of performance and power-related data through registers that can be read by software. You can use the NVIDIA Data Center GPU Manager (DCGM) API to access these registers on Linux systems. Here is an example Python script that uses DCGM to get the real-time power consumption of the A100 GPU:

```
import dcgm_structs
import dcgm_agent
import dcgmvalue

# Define a function to get the real-time power consumption of the GPU
def get_gpu_power_usage():
    # Create a DCGM handle
    handle = dcgm_agent.dcgmInit()

    # Get the GPU ID of the A100
    gpu_list = dcgm_agent.dcgmGetAllDevices(handle)
    gpu_id = next((gpu.id for gpu in gpu_list if gpu.attributes.arch == dcgm_structs.DCGM_GPU_ARCH_VOLTA), None)

    # Get the current power usage of the GPU from the power management subsystem
    field_id = dcgm_structs.DCGM_FI_DEV_POWER_USAGE
    field_value = dcgm_agent.dcgmEntityGetLatestValues(handle, dcgm_structs.DCGM_FE_GPU, gpu_id, field_id)[0]
    power_usage_watts = dcgmvalue.DcgmFloat64(field_value.value).value

    # Cleanup the DCGM handle
    dcgm_agent.dcgmShutdown()

    return power_usage_watts

# Print the real-time power consumption of the GPU
power_usage_watts = get_gpu_power_usage()
print(f"GPU Power Usage (W): {power_usage_watts:.2f}")
```

This script uses the DCGM API to create a handle to the NVIDIA Data Center GPU Manager, get the GPU ID of the A100, and get the current power usage of the GPU from the power management subsystem's `DCGM_FI_DEV_POWER_USAGE` field.


Note that to use this script, you will need to install the NVIDIA Data Center GPU Manager (`dcgm`) library and Python bindings. You can download the library and bindings from the NVIDIA website.


Another way to get real-time power consumption data of the A100 GPU is to use hardware monitoring tools such as those provided by vendors like Lm-Sensors or Zabbix. These tools can monitor the power consumption of various system components, including the GPU, by reading data from sensors on the hardware. However, they typically require more configuration and setup than using `nvidia-smi` or DCGM.
